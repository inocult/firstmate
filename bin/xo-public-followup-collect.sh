# xo-public-followup-collect.sh - read and retire the typed terminal events a
# worker in THIS home staged for an owning home on another machine.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: a public promise is kept by the home that owns the relay
# consent and the thread binding. When the bound work lives in a REMOTE
# secondmate home, that worker has no local path to the owning home's inbox, so
# `xo-public-followup-emit.sh --stage-in` leaves the typed event in this home's
# public-followup outbox instead. The owning home runs THIS command over the
# route's own transport (bin/xo-on.sh) to collect what is waiting. The transport
# only runs main -> secondmate, so collection is a pull; nothing here ever
# reaches back out.
#
# WHAT IT DOES NOT DO: it never builds, edits, posts, or judges an event. The
# staged bytes are handed over verbatim, and the collecting home re-validates
# every field against its own registration and tasks-axi before accepting one.
#
# Usage:
#   xo-public-followup-collect.sh drain <obligation-id>
#       Print every staged event for <obligation-id>, one compact JSON document
#       per line, newest-first order not guaranteed. NON-DESTRUCTIVE: a dropped
#       connection must never be able to lose a terminal result, so the staged
#       copy is retained until the collecting home has it durably and retires it
#       with `drop`. Prints nothing and exits 0 when nothing is staged.
#
#   xo-public-followup-collect.sh drop <obligation-id> <event-id>
#       Retire one staged event once the collecting home holds it durably.
#       Idempotent: an already-absent event is a success, so a repeated or
#       replayed retirement is safe.
#
# XO_HOME selects the home to read, exactly as every other command the remote
# entrypoint runs. Events are matched on their own obligation_id field, never on
# a filename, so a hand-placed file cannot be collected under another loop's id.
#
# Output: drain prints event JSON on stdout, one per line. Exit 0 on success,
# including an empty outbox and an outbox holding a file too large or too broken
# to hand over - that one is named on stderr and left in place rather than
# blocking every other staged result. Exit 2 on a usage or validation error, and
# 1 when the outbox cannot be safely read or a retirement cannot be completed.
