# Turn-end guard for any xo PRIMARY session: the main home OR a
# secondmate's own home. A secondmate runs its own primary xo session and
# is guarded exactly like the main primary; only child crew/scout worktrees are
# exempt (see the scoping block below and docs/turnend-guard.md).
#
# xo-guard.sh (bin/xo-guard.sh) is pull-based: it only warns when some other
# supervision script happens to run. A primary session that ends a turn without
# resuming its harness supervision protocol, and then never runs another
# fleet-touching command itself, can sit blind for hours.
# This script is push-based: verified harness turn-end hooks invoke it every time
# the primary is about to end a turn.
# Claude and codex can block directly by preserving exit status 2 and stderr.
# OpenCode and pi adapters use the same predicate and force one bounded
# follow-up because their turn-end events are passive. Grok delegates native
# blocking when its running Stop payload advertises that capability, with one
# bounded resume fallback for payloads from pre-native processes. Cursor calls
# this guard back with --cursor from bin/xo-turnend-guard-cursor.sh and renders
# exit 2 as one bounded follow-up, because exit 2 is a silent no-op on Cursor's
# stop step; without that flag a Cursor-shaped payload is the Claude-settings
# duplicate Cursor also loads, and this guard stands down.
# See docs/turnend-guard.md for the per-harness mechanics, validation evidence,
# and fail-open tradeoffs.
#
# Ships with TRACKED harness hook files at the repo root, so this file is
# checked out into every worktree of this repo: the primary checkout, every
# secondmate home (treehouse-leased or git-cloned), and any crewmate/scout task
# worktree spawned to work on xo itself (the recursive "xo
# improving itself" case). A secondmate home runs its OWN primary xo
# session, so it must be guarded like the main primary; only child crew/scout
# worktrees are exempt. It must therefore scope itself at runtime to a real
# primary checkout - the main home or a genuinely marked secondmate home - and
# stay a silent, fast no-op inside child task worktrees.
#
# Away mode (state/.afk): the away-mode daemon owns supervision and runs the
# watcher one-shot, restarting it after every wake, so the watch lock is
# regularly unheld at a turn boundary with nothing wrong. A live
# identity-matched daemon holding this home, plus a fresh beacon, is what
# proves supervision there - see xo_afk_daemon_owns_supervision in
# bin/xo-wake-lib.sh. The beacon freshness test there uses AFK_GRACE
# (xo_poll_derived_grace, docs/turnend-guard.md "Guard grace and the poll
# cadence"), not the flat $GRACE every other check on this page uses: the
# daemon starts a fresh one-shot watcher only after it finishes handling the
# previous wake, and that handling can legitimately run past a flat 300s
# window under load (a slow registered check, a busy supervisor pane) with the
# daemon perfectly healthy throughout. The strict watcher predicate and $GRACE
# are unchanged everywhere else, including for a dead daemon pid or a beacon
# older than AFK_GRACE, which still block.
#
# Loop-guard, codex/Grok (default) mode: never block twice in the same turn.
# Codex uses stop_hook_active and Grok uses stopHookActive; typed camel-case
# takes precedence when both spellings are present. A true value means the
# current stop attempt already follows a block, so this guard always allows it.
# Passive harness adapters provide their own one-follow-up guard before calling
# this script.
# That bounds those harnesses to at most one forced continuation per turn -
# never a wedged, un-endable session - while still nagging again on a later turn
# if the problem persists.
#
# Loop-guard, --claude mode (Stop-owned auto-arm cooperation): Claude Code
# marks EVERY stop after ANY stop-hook-driven continuation stop_hook_active=true,
# including turns started by the asyncRewake auto-arm, so the one-shot allow
# would re-open the exact blind window this guard exists to close
# (docs/turnend-guard.md records the 2026-07-21 incident). In --claude mode this
# guard ignores stop_hook_active and instead cooperates with the Stop-owned
# auto-arm (bin/xo-claude-stop-autoarm.sh), which fires on the same Stop event:
#   1. a live identity-matched watcher with a fresh beacon - or, in away mode, a
#      live identity-matched daemon with a fresh beacon - allows immediately;
#   2. otherwise wait briefly (XO_CLAUDE_AUTOARM_SYNC_WAIT_MS, default 800ms)
#      for the auto-arm to claim this home (a live OPEN generation claim in the
#      state/.claude-autoarm-epoch ledger - xo_autoarm_claim_open - or a legacy
#      build's lock-holding claim under the legacy abandonment proof) or to
#      record a fresh actionable exit-2 outcome
#      (state/.claude-autoarm-epoch) for this event epoch - either proof allows
#      without consuming a continuation, so one event epoch yields exactly one recovery turn;
#      the first fresh exhausted-failure epoch preserves the bounded progression,
#      while later fresh failed epochs consume it instead of resetting it;
#   3. only when neither materializes is the auto-arm genuinely absent: re-block
#      with the repair banner, bounded to XO_CLAUDE_TURNEND_BLOCK_BUDGET
#      (default 3) consecutive blocks per session - safely below Claude Code's
#      hard 8-consecutive-block override - then allow one loud attended
#      fail-open only for an already verified failure episode. The budget
#      charges each event epoch once, and it also charges every re-block
#      against an epoch the auto-arm never advanced past the previous
#      re-block (budget_account_current_epoch owns that rule), so an inert
#      hook that leaves the ledger frozen cannot hold the guard in an
#      unbounded re-block loop below that override.

# otherwise), whose git-dir lives under the parent repo's .git/worktrees/<name>
# and differs from the common (shared) git-dir, while a main, non-worktree

#
# Budget accounting, under the budget lock. Sets COUNT (the session's
# consumed continuations, including this one) and BUDGET_INITIALIZED_FAILURE.
# The ledger's epoch identity is what is charged: a new epoch charges once,
# and an epoch this same invocation already charged is never charged again,
# because the wait loop above can observe one fresh terminal epoch many times
# before the block decision. Across Stops the two callers differ:
#   - observe (the allow paths in autoarm_owns_recovery): seeing an
#     already-charged epoch again is free - it is the same claim, seen again.
#   - block (the re-block path): a re-block against the epoch the previous
#     re-block already charged is a new consumed continuation, because the
#     auto-arm advanced nothing between the two Stops - it did not participate
#     at all, which is exactly the absence this budget bounds. Charging only
#     epoch changes let an inert hook (identity-gated, never fired, or failing
#     before its generation claim) freeze the ledger and the count together,
